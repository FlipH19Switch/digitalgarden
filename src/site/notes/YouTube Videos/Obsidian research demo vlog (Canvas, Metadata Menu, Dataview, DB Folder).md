## Transcript
[00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1) all right so this video was originally going to be a live stream but because it would be my first time live streaming on YouTube I need to wait out a 24hour time frame so anyway I've I had 
[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=19) some things that I needed to get done and I just haven't I've been procrastinating with them so I thought I would do them live um and get some momentum in the areas 
[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=32) and basically just document it um see what comes of it so what those things are are actually making progress with logging some of the research that I've come across and deriving insights 
[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=46) from it and then making upgrades to the system so really this video is going to be a demonstration of my research system as it currently works and I'll be highlighting along the way the issues 
[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=62) uh that I've come across with it and what fixes I want to make and really just depending on how much time I have um how long it takes to get through one of the 
[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=73) studies I might begin making fixes or upgrades to the system itself um so with that in mind let's take a look 
[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=86) at this canvas that I've put together so so since the video that I put out um originally to to demonstrate or to walk through the research system that I was using I've made just a few upgrades to 
[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=104) it the main one is actually using multiple canvases so anybody that's actually tried to put together and play with the system that I was using quickly notice just how unwieldy 
[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=122) it becomes so very difficult to navigate you can see there's arrows going everywhere um so what I found out is that with metadata menu it is fairly easy 
[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=134) to use multiple canvases and still Trace back through the links to find similar items meaning that um I could have I could create insights and takeways put them in different canvases and have 
[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=152) errors linking to them and still the code that I come up with to trace back through those links would still be able to find insights and original studies uh across 
[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=165) canvases so this specific canvas is dedicated to nutrition um and specifically I really just been looking at 
[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=177) supplements uh and we'll get into one of those today but as you can see I mean it's it's not easy to navigate um you can use a plugin called Simple canvas search which will let you search through 
[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=191) the canvas itself which is really helpful you can search for individual file names um but that only goes so far there's another plugin that I tried I 
[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=202) can't remember the name of it but it it set up a screen over here that was suppos to help navigate where you were supposed to be able to click around sort of like Muro if you've 
[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=216) ever used Muro um but it didn't work well so because it's an infinite canvas and it's not easy to navigate it can continue to grow and grow and grow and it can be 
[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=230) very difficult to find your uh place so anyway I've split out I've gone from one canvas to several I can't remember how many 
[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=244) I've got working right now um but even within one canvas again if you've played around with this system at all you quickly notice just how tedious it is or how much effort it takes to really think 
[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=257) through Insight creation and take away generation and basically extracting all the information you want to from studies which is really nice I don't think that's a bad that thing uh as I did 
[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=271) mention in the original video though it it is somewhat inefficient or you could argue it's inefficient what it really hinders me from doing is quickly adding notes on 
[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=286) something in fact it becomes has become quite a barrier to me actually wanting to dive into the research because I know on the other end as soon as I dive in it's going to take a lot of time I need 
[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=299) to dedicate a lot of time and focus to actually making use of something and I'm not sure that's always necessary um so 
[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=313) anyway this video I'm going to demonstrate one of these in fact you can see how much I've been procrastinating uh I've worked through several studies that I wanted to derive insights from 
[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=327) and then I thought that if I got momentum by just parsing out the um Source content from several other studies that eventually I would come back to them and derive the insights but 
[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=343) haven't gotten around to it yet so the last one that I left off with I'm going to work on now and uh you can see you know my thought process 
[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=356) and um yeah this is just how it goes so anyway this study today is about uthan a I became very interested in uthan a after a podcast called the metabolic 
[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=374) link and anog Singh was the guest and talked about uthan a um he heads up a company called timeline nutrition and he also is on several of the studies on 
[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=391) uthan a so anyway looking at the research on urethan a um I became really interested in it because it was there is some research to suggest it can prevent the progression of 
[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=406) osteoarthritis and intervertebral dis degeneration and I'm very interested in both of those things so I wanted to come up with some sort of framework 
[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=419) or see if it's worth actually using the supplement um and yeah so this is one of those studies so actually as the title suggests this is about intervertebral 
[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=432) dis degeneration um it's an invivo study which is nice unfortunately it's not in humans but at least in the r model they can 
[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=445) see uh outcomes in terms of um I believe it's a puncture model and they can see the progression of disc degeneration after puncturing a disc and um the results are 
[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=460) promising so if I remember correctly I think pqq and uthan a are the only supplements I've actually looked at so far in this nutrition 
[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=475) canvas um and one of the studies that I come back to a lot that actually feeds into many insights across studies is animal dosing so this study right here not study this is an 
[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=498) FDA handbook I guess of some sort but anyway it's a it's a guide to dosing in humans uh based on animal doses so not perfect looks like it's uh based 
[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=516) on surface area of the animal if I'm not mistaken but it does give some multiplication or division factors to use with with animal dosing so a lot of these studies are in mice and rats so 
[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=532) that comes in really handy when trying to determine what or estimate what an equivalent human dose of something would be so all that is to say I'm still 
[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=548) procrastinating as you can see uh to actually dive into this thing so in this study where it begin let's see the main things that I want to 
[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=566) understand about this compound are the how it works if it works in Vivo and uh what dose was used if so or actually if it didn't work I'd like to know what dose was used as well 
[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=582) so anyway this one in this case it did seem to work um now in these studies there's there are often extra details right so uh um if anybody actually watches 
[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=599) video I'm probably speaking to the choir about information in studies and results and what if you were to take the results of a study and try to use them in either your own life 
[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=615) or um in your own research then arguably the most important are going to be the invivo results and everything else is um often mean istic or trying to understand exactly how it's working or not 
[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=633) working um and it's you know all the results are presented as a story so and you can see that as you go through a result section they're often 
[10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=645) presented as if as if there was a clear line of thinking when performing the study they did this thing and then they got this result and then they did this thing and then they got this result um 
[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=657) if you've worked in research you know this not necessarily the case uh anyway tangent so what I'm trying to get at is this stuff is cool but for my purposes I want to know the 
[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=674) objective measures for the invivo work and the uh methods that they used to measure those things and arrive at those results meaning okay in this case they have uh Day Zero 
[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=692) and day 28 um results from let's see these look like x-ray results looking at DIS space or they call it dis height index and some 
[11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=706) changes um from those so I'm most interested in these so I believe that's probably yeah that's what I actually derived or had had uh 
[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=720) taken from the study with plans to use so that means this figure and this figure this figure anything that is immediately useful to tell me whether or not this compound um 
[12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=735) could be useful for me so what I need to do is take these figures and combine them with the original methods to derive in insights so we've got the animal 
[12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=757) model um the surgical surgical procedure the MRI oh is that MRI or x-ray okay well anyway it's like they did 
[13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=798) both so oh well here MRI images makes sense so insights I can derive from this well one I need to know the dose so they have already 
[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=835) calculated um the do so this is the dose in rats and what I'm going to do is just put a note out here and go ahead 
[14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=857) and find Sor it's kind of slowing down um I need to find the dosing 
[14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=897) study okay so they Ed 25 milligrams per kilogram per day so actually I could have done that here going do a placeholder so this is an issue I'm not sure how to 
[15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=939) get around which is when things are spaced around the canvas really far and you need to connect them this is really messy one it's kind of slow is 
[16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=961) not navigating very quickly two it's far away and so it creates this ridiculously long hero this is hilarious so in the past I had set I 
[16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=986) have set up databases using DB folder and data View and instead of connecting things 
[16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=999) with arrows I would here we go I would select I could create insights basically at it's part of 
[16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1013) relational databases um but even then it's it's all about finding things that's the big difficulty is like say you create an 
[17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1026) insight and you don't remember the exact wording of it but you you have two evidence sources that um or pieces of source content that would support that Insight 
[17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1043) or maybe you have two insights that support another Insight it's all about finding things so visually this really 
[17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1055) helps but if you've ever again used Miro much easier to get around and navigate moo than this 
[17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1068) and move things around grouping things um anyway so I know I'm going to need this it's going to add support for whatever 
[18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1083) insights that I'm going to make here because basically all those insights are tied to the dosing strategy now it has been a while since I created an Insight in here so I'm going 
[18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1097) to jump back to some of the last ones that I made and just see my wording on them so I'm actually going to copy that and use 
[18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1111) it as a a guide all right let's see how this does so this is the table of insights and another problem with this 
[18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1137) system is or really with the tools that the system relies on is the creation of insights here um what exactly was that problem there's a problem which makes me create 
[19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1155) placeholder notes in Mass while I'm working through stuff um I'll remember exactly what that issue was but anyway what I usually do is create a bunch of placeholder notes 
[19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1169) and then come back and uh click into them and edit them so might as well keep that off to the side now I need to word this 
[19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1184) thing so that's not it okay anyway I'll just serve as inspiration I don't need to copy it this is interesting speaking out loud 
[20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1212) as I work through stuff uh probably weird to listen and watch if anybody is actually doing that so let's see the study what do I want to do 
[20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1229) I want to record an Insight basically what they found is that between figure a and figure B shows that there is a significant 
[20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1248) difference in the progression of I mean technically it's the progression of disc degeneration wonder if these were adult 
[21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1283) mice 12 weeks old so the reason I reason I ask that is I'm I'm wondering if uh the discs were fully formed by the time that this model was used um which I believe was a 
[21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1302) dis puncture seems pretty common yeah so disfunction model uh so I need to know 
[22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1340) when so quick Google search looks like um these are male rats stop growing around 9 months old okay so these are adult male rats which means that their discs should be fully formed 
[22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1359) by the time that the disc puncture occurs and so that means that uthan a can prevent the Progressive loss of dis 
[23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1382) height following dis puncture yeah so these titles do have a maximum number of words so take that in consideration it gets 
[23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1435) really wordy or try to get very information DSE get as much detail in as possible uthan a prevents the progressive loss of invertebral I'm going to 
[24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1449) say intervertebral disc height following a punction model in adult male rats a to of that's another issue is that 
[24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1472) since so I use titles to make it easily easy to find um that means the file name has 
[24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1485) restrictions and those include backs slashes or slashes I can't remember which ones no these are forward slashes back slashes probably don't work either yeah 
[24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1499) so milligrams per kilogram per day could be spelled out but that takes up more space and it reads weird anyway so this is how I do it so milligrams per kilogram per 
[25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1518) day now is that consistent with other insights yeah there's a dosing time I need the timeline so actually I should have 
[25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1537) copied this I don't have a fully fleshed out set of principles to go on kind of learning as I go with this to stay consistent 
[26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1566) so the dose is there how long did they take it four weeks now one interesting thing just as 
[26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1610) a side note for uthan a dosing uh it's really common for them to give it as part of the diet um so this dose just thinking all louded and it's mixed with the rodent 
[27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1627) diet at a certain concentration but it really assumes um a lot with regards to unless they're weighing the food and they actually averaged it 
[27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1642) out uh I guess it it assumes some so this is not an exact but it's a ballpark anyway where am I am 
[27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1668) lost more problems with the system you can get lost uh usually I've got three main screens or yeah three fairly large screens and then a laptop 
[28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1683) screen sometimes um which really helps but I want to get as much inside this one frame as possible 
[28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1694) um so what do I need to do this is the new one PR I'm trying to model it after after an ivd puncture 
[29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1752) this is definitely a learning experience here Progressive loss of dis height in a dose after an ivd puncture at 12 months of 
[29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1785) ageed to all right I think that does does it oh 12 weeks old how did I not catch that these are young mice okay well 
[30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1851) that that would take away or change the Insight uh or change my interpretation of the data because just thinking of other possible explanations for the change in dis 
[31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1865) height um or the the key how that would relate so getting past just the insights what possible takeaways could I gener or could this Insight be useful 
[31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1881) for I mean so your Athan a could be working through a mechanism that's not present in adults um these are 
[31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1896) arguably developing discs I guess I could I could try to look into to finding you know when exactly does the rat's intervertebral disc stop 
[31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1909) developing uh but that was send me down a rabbit hole so what I'm going to do this is where assumptions come into place and assumptions are 
[32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1925) inevitable so what I'll need to do is I'm going to test this for all right so working with the canvas means that I have to search for 
[33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=1990) files so what I'm going to try to do is I'll just add files on a separate screen I wonder if they appear I wonder if it's synced add a file 
[33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2008) it's not synced oh it is there just a delay that's cool okay so with this one Insight that has taken I don't know how many 
[33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2022) minutes to generate the information I used came from the animal section talked about the dis puncture it's drawing 
[34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2048) from it's based on 4 a and 4B yeah and it is I mean that's not just marginally different that's interesting I wonder and they're not statistically 
[34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2070) significant but within four weeks there was a change in discite index or potentially nonsignificant change in discite 
[34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2083) Index this follows between those two that's interesting I mean these are Ry I wonder if the curve tells anything that 
[35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2104) indicates like segment instability or anything that's that's got some curve that could just be the setup but these are like jagged that's 
[35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2132) good all right anyway so many tangents um so I used 4 a and 4 B which means I used 
[35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2151) radiographic analysis so yeah at the very so anytime I'm looking at a study first thing if I want to use it in here the first thing I do is find out what 
[36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2169) results are relevant to any takeaways I'm looking to create down the line and really it comes down to actions so this is another key part of the 
[36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2185) system that I need to that I've begun working on but actions and outcomes um it's another part of the system that I'll need to work 
[36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2201) through put more work into um to make it more usable for myself and for anybody else um which is why I would look at the study in the first place so in my case I 
[36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2218) want to um you know the outcome would be prevent progression of osteoarthritis and prevent progression of dis degeneration so that's what the goal 
[37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2233) that I'm working towards is finding anything that could support those outcomes so when I'm looking through the studies I'm looking for any data that would most directly translate to those 
[37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2249) outcomes or actually you most like those outcomes I guess mechanisms are interesting but right now I don't I'm not so concerned about mechanisms um or a lot of inv vitro work 
[37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2261) uh a lot of inv vitro work uses fairly high concentrations or concentrations that I I don't know how realistic they are to Target um for example in you know if these 
[37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2278) nucleus pulposis cells are treated with 20 Millar uthan a for me to to really be able to use that information I I would need to know what's realistic in terms of what 
[38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2296) concentrations of uthan a could I expect to see within an invertebral disc after supplementing with uthan a I mean is it realistic to get up to 20 m ER I have no idea so I don't if I can wherever 
[38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2314) possible go with the invivo stuff and anyway that's what drew me to figures four five and six um and when I do that I grab the figures that I'm interested in and I 
[38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2329) grab the methods that seem most relevant to those so a lot of this is probably really obvious I'm just talking my way through it 
[39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2346) uh where am I keep getting lost all right so I don't think I need the histopathologic analysis that'll be that look like figure six so that is one 
[39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2360) Insight but yeah and while I'm working on this Insight I might as well well I need to log that assumption and this is a point I'm not 
[39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2374) 100% on with the system itself is where to attach the assumptions in this case the assumption is that the age of the 
[39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2389) animal does not affect the outcome so actually would not be an assumption for this I could just attach the Assumption to the next Insight where I 
[40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2419) basically translate or transform this insight into a more malleable form that I could use with other insights or is more closely related to my target 
[40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2433) outcome which is I'm a human if I'm going to take your Athan a what can I expect so for 
[40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2449) now let's see how I did it with other ones wow I've been working recording for 40 minutes already and I've got one Insight so you can 
[41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2477) see just how much goes into one or Insight creation actually most relevant would be the one I looked at before 
[41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2512) okay here's how I've done it in the past yeah I think what makes most sense is to group things because all of these are markers 
[42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2541) of dis degeneration or yeah these are results related to disc degeneration or I yeah ivd degeneration so what I did was derive these insights and then group them together into 
[42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2559) one because I'm not so concerned about the specifics like discite or college and incorporation I just want to know can it prevent in general this 
[42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2577) generation or not so I think grouping them together like I've done here so creating another basically creating all the Baseline insights grouping them into one 
[43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2590) more General and attaching the Assumption about age to that one would make the most sense so as you can see that's what I've done here group them into here and this 
[43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2603) was also 25 milligram per kilogram per day these were bit older 
[43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2620) rats and tie them in here and actually this one needs an assumption about age as well because these are not fully developed rats okay 
[44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2641) so so derive the insights group them and use them so the next Insight is going to be all right so use that one I think that's why I do these like this 
[44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2677) because I create yeah that's why I create a bunch of placeholders at once because there's not a whole lot of space to work with and to think 
[44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2689) through when adding the file name so what I do is create a bunch of placeholder ones that I can then click into separ separately and have all this uh space to work 
[45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2710) with all right so I can do a similar make a similar insight about uh farming grades so let's see what I can do is basically copy 
[45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2723) this create a separate insight prevents the progressive it's not a loss of Fairman grade but again come back to see how I've done 
[45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2748) it before reduces the feirman grade ah even that even that's not worded 
[46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2777) great uthan a does not reduce the feuring grade what it does is it prevents the reduction and not even prevent it 
[46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2803) mitigates how do you say prevent progression or slow progression uh there's a I think they use a meates is a commonly word commonly used word in these studies but even that 
[47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2833) doesn't really capture I mean basically we don't know what happens after the four- week Mark so this would reduce the 
[47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2858) progression I mean it's really the progressive increase in yeah so just as a side note I've been really INSP inspired to do something like this even though it may never be 
[48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2882) seen um especially never be seen like the full video but um Nicole vanderhoven uh she and I think she's the main inspiration for working in public like 
[48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2901) this just to get get this out there um but she in interviews podcasts um or videos all the above she talks about the concept of continuous integration 
[48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2921) continuous delivery um in not just the software development world but also in your own note taking and I know that's part of the zle 
[48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2932) Casten system as I understand it is to go back through and update regularly but anyway it's a perfect example looking at something again with fresh eyes different 
[49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2945) day it's not worried correctly it wasn't worried correctly and I'm sure that there are many other cases like that so uh yeah so anyway I'll just I can't get 
[49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2960) bogg down looking for all the places where it's not worded correctly I'll just fix them as I come across and so in this case prevents 
[49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2975) the how did I word it reduces a progressive increase slows we don't know the 
[49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=2997) I mean yeah slows the increase doesn't need to be Progressive we just know where it was and at one time point and at another time point 
[50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3018) soose the progression really that's probably okay it slows the progression of feirman grade yep so that's a new 
[51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3073) insight go back to the board see it magically appear and in this case got the age of the animals we've got the puncture 
[51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3099) model we've got the MRI methods and we've got the MRI results okay now the histological analysis so I don't again this is a 
[52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3138) situation where I'm not that concerned about the specific spefic staining results I'm more interested in taking 
[52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3155) the overall uh data presented here collectively what Insight I can drive so it looks like it prevents the reduces the 
[52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3172) progression in histologic score it's really fluffy uh in fact histologic score if I remember correctly I've seen in different studies that can mean 
[53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3186) completely opposite things or be measured in completely opposite ways so sometimes a better hologic score or a higher hyic score is better some or 
[53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3202) more normal and sometimes a lower or sometimes in the uh untreated punct model as an example they would have reduced his 
[53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3222) logic scores compared to Sham or control animals I guess sham no probably control yeah uh and another study that would have higher htic score so anyway I'm 
[54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3240) going to go back to see how I did this before how I worded it because this is probably similar well this says increases the histologic score 
[54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3255) so it's also not the best way to describe it so here I mean at the end of the day it's it's narrowing the 
[54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3281) gap between the group that was treated narrowing the gap between the animals that had the ivd puncture and those that did 
[55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3301) not so I think just for Simplest just to prevent a headache um and I really don't like that I could say improves but it's not a 
[55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3324) specific or slows the worsening what would be nice is to know if these are significantly different from each other but we 
[56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3385) don't for I think since I'm not using I'm spending way too much time on this it really bothers me um to get that wording right because I 
[57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3436) know I'm just going to accumulate more and more insights around that or similar insights 
[57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3452) anyway what does it do it uh it reduce it slows the increase in the histologic score for yep there it is I'll go back and fix the 
[58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3513) other one nope for yeah so in this case it's slowed the reduction 
[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3612) okay I'm an hour in I've got three insights which may not be the M best uh measure but so now I'm going to combine these into one that I can 
[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3635) use oh that's good okay so so overall slows the progression of ivd to generation for yeah 
[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3731) huh did this just not update why can't I rename that for okay uh wow I think I just got caught a loop 
[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3797) um did I just copy I think I just copied a title corrected it as a was changing it and then went back to update the oh 
[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3812) man okay so EUR a slows the progression of ivd to generation now I should be able to do it there we go 
[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3851) okay now these support this and now I have some something more usable CU I'm more interested in overall dis 
[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3875) degeneration and the potential of your lithan a to slow or prevent the progression now I need to ah okay so here 
[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3897) this may not be necessary let's see how I did it in the past so in the past I did the general one 
[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3919) okay so this column is takeaways and this this is already translated into a human dose so it already has the 
[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3940) dose equivalence this is not necessary I need to connect this directly it's probably not this one nope 
[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=3991) yep there we go now so previously the Assumption was tied directly to the takeaway for and this is 
[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4012) a general assumption ivd degeneration progress is similarly between rats and humans we also need to assume that the punct model is an adequate is adequate 
[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4030) for yeah and see in that case put it here I tied it to this but it's it's not really where it should go oh this another update I'll need 
[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4055) to add to a future dedicated video on the system is that it was pointed out to me uh luckily that the arrows should be going from the assumptions to the insights or to the takeaways instead of 
[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4070) the other way around because really it's arrows Point towards whatever they're supporting and this is really better more 
[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4094) appropriate here and this is where we can I can add the age assumption as well so here's how I can do that for 
[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4182) so now how to word this I mean technically there are a couple of assumptions that would be made it's not just that I i d generation progresses similarly between rats and 
[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4198) humans is that IBD progression ivd degeneration progresses similarly amongst Rats of all 
[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4248) PES and really I man it's assumption's all the way down you could say that IBD 
[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4267) degeneration something about how urolith and a would affect ivd degeneration the same across Rats of all ages 
[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4286) and this is specifically in response to a puncture model okay I think I'm getting really into the weeds here I'm not sure it's necessary to go 
[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4316) [Music] well he might as well I'm here let's do it I won't have these types of assumptions everywhere but guess the goal is to 
[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4370) always do better so it's really the effect of real liant a on you at the end of the day these 
[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4421) assumptions are basically collectively reminders that all this these insights are are that amongst all the 
[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4442) insights there are some from animal models using Rats of different ages and those models involve IBD punctures H so 
[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4461) anyway I think that's that at least demonstrates how much 
[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4473) effort currently goes into creating insights and in this case supporting a takeaway that uh I already created um now luckily as long as I 
[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4490) calculated everything correctly 25 migr per kilogram in a rat is it translates to a fairly low dose in 
[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4504) humans so 4 milligrams per kilogram per day in humans um say 70 kgam person would be about 280 milligram of urethan a per 
[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4519) day uh timeline nutrition there uthan a supplement Mito pure comes at a dose of 500 Mig per day 
[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4535) so based on the rat data uh that's good now the mouse data just thinking out loud Mouse data I believe it was for yeah that was for arthritis 
[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4558) there must have been a mouse study on disc degeneration maybe not yeah so arthritis is larger uh that came from a mouse study 
[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4583) anyway uh so yeah I am not going to begin implementing the changes to the system right now I'll record that in 
[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4597) another um working video like this this was a test hopefully the mower is not too loud uh [Music] 
[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4615) yeah if anybody made it through let me know what you think um again it's a work in progress this is just documenting the journey and it's all learning and 
[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4630) uh yeah I do plan on making the system better more usable more easily usable for quick ads that's the next big thing to add here I'm also working on 
[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPp9-jH-Fg&t=4646) ways to organize notes and things like that so anyway until next time
