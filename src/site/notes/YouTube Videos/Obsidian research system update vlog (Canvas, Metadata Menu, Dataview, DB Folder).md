## Transcript
[00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1) okay so this video is documenting an upgrade that I want to make in the research system that I currently use in obsidian so I use canvas metadata menu data View and DB folder those are the 
[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=17) main plugins involved in the system along with a couple of or a few scripts that I wrote um and the purpose is to to log insights from research studies and patents and other evidence sources that 
[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=32) I come across and ultimately Come Away with takeaways that are basically um supported by insights from various 
[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=47) evidence sources now the evidence system has many flaws and it's by no means perfect um if you saw my last video where I demonstrated actually the 
[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=63) process I used to derive takeaways or derive insights to support takeaways um and then you saw how inefficient it can be and how cumbersome it can be uh but I do think that the 
[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=78) visual aspect of the canvas and being able to quickly connect things and then use scripts to trace back to essentially create a a breadcrumb trail I do think that's incredibly 
[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=91) valuable so I don't think it's worth throwing out the system completely but basically tackling big issues in order of importance as they they come up and the biggest issue right 
[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=104) now that I have with the system is that I can't quickly add new things it takes a lot of time and intense focus and deliberating over wording 
[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=120) to come away with anything that I'm confident in when I currently use the system um and actually since my initial video documenting the system I have made a few 
[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=136) upgrades they're not major but one of them is being able to well I've tested out using multiple canvases and what I found is because just the sheer surface area that's required for this 
[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=153) kind of linking things together it becomes very difficult to navigate and so I've created canvases specific to different areas of research that I'm interested in so this one is 
[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=167) nutrition I've got another one uh for orthobiologic treatments um I have a few more planned but just haven't taken the time to dive into those yet 
[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=181) um so all this is to say that today all I'm going to do is add a quick ad feature because I think that should be fairly simple to do at least in to get it up and 
[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=196) running now if you want to follow along with the upgrades that I plan to make to the system or issues that I'm coming across or just general notes on it I do keep track of 
[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=211) it in this area of my web page so I've got public whiteboards I call the system Atomic evidence kind of like Atomic note taking um and actually I haven't updated this I haven't synced it although this 
[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=226) is up to date this is how um I'm organizing things organizing uh evidence sources right now so um you can see my video is transparent I 
[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=240) haven't figured that out in uh OBS yet but anyway um so there's like a color scheme uh yeah so that's 
[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=259) that you know I've got this I can show but what I'm finding is that in a separate window excal draw actually won't let me navigate very easily so these are the upgrades and so the main 
[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=274) upgrade I want to make is quick storage of insights or quick ad for imature insights so I'm developing quite the backlog of stuff that I want to derive insights from or that you know I've got 
[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=288) some idea in the moment or I've got a a note that I want to take on something really quickly but I just don't have the time or the interest in 
[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=300) tearing apart the study the way I have here so you can see here you know all it results in is just a lot of um procrastinating and so this was an initial backlog but in reality the 
[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=316) backlog goes really deep so to give an idea and I'm sure this is the same for everybody it's much easier to accumulate evidence sources than it is to take the 
[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=333) time and put the thought into writing down notes on everything so I don't need to see it anyway what I need to do is create a new 
[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=348) canvas the way I'm I'm thinking this through is at the end of the day I want to create a system some very similar to this except it would be the 
[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=364) evidence Source ties directly to an Insight there's no need to piece anything apart um but it would it needs to remove some 
[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=376) of the real sticking points of this system which are the amount of time it takes to strip out all of the necessary components of a study or or components 
[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=389) I'm interested in combine those together and derive a really uh you know deliberately worded Insight I need 
[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=402) to I want to tie the study directly to an Insight but that Insight should also be could also be tied to other studies so one of the problems here in these canvases is for the for this purpose 
[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=419) purp is look at how much space it takes up for one study potentially and then you know even there's one study I don't remember what this was so I've been interested in 
[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=430) a couple of supplements this one's pqq so the effect of pqq on osteoarthritis so I had this Grand idea that I was I'd been making progress you 
[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=447) know on some of these studies but there were so many more that I wanted to do I thought okay well what if I just go ahead and piece out the source content then the next day I could come 
[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=457) back and derive the insights well that next day never came and it just it's waiting there for me to do um so you know in some cases it can take 
[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=472) up tons of space to you know derive the insights that I want to from a study and what that does is it creates huge gaps between insights that I 
[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=490) connect to multiple different things so for example um here this is the FDA guidance for dosing right so if I'm logging a lot of animal 
[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=508) studies I'm going to use the dosing table I'm going to tie that to a lot of things and what that means is look at all this look at how far I have to tie these things together this 
[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=522) is going all the way down here and as I add more studies is just going to get larger or longer and longer and longer so I want direct study to Insight and what that could look like 
[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=539) potten potentially is it' be much easier I can keep everything in one column and I can move things around I could even you know open up a column and add things in Block in one 
[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=554) area and have them all connected to one Insight because you know in many cases it's some supplement I'm interested in and there are several studies on that supplement 
[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=564) and one particular outcome anyway I think it can be done pretty quickly I can do it in one canvas and I can use one script to trace back 
[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=585) and find the original studies so that's my thinking right now let's dive in so the first step is going to 
[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=602) be what I'm going to need I'll need a canvas I'll need a new database folder and I'll eventually need another script and then I'll begin testing it so I'll create the 
[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=623) canvas so unfortunately I can't show all this because this is my person personal Vault so I'll create a canvas for [Music] 
[11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=694) and this is just going to be quick notes now I need to do I have to add a new class no I don't need to 
[11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=717) add a new class I've got my research links class that's what I have to do I'm going test this out 
[12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=745) yeah okay so since my last video what I what I do is create one file class so research links is what I call 
[12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=759) the file class itself but I need a separate field for each of the canvases so I'll create a new field name 
[12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=779) it's a risk to call it quicknotes because I may I'll likely end up with multiple canvases named that will be some version of quick notes but we'll see I may not need 
[13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=794) multiple canvases in the future because the idea is that it it's it's not permanent it's not I don't want it to be permanent it will probably be probably be permanent 
[13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=807) for some notes that I just never take the time to fully flesh out but the idea is not to just use this to accumulate massive quantities of immature notes it would be a place for 
[13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=825) things to go quickly and then even over time I could say okay this it this Insight looks like it is uh it's becoming pretty popular right so I might as well begin 
[13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=839) turning that into like actually flushing that out and Diving really deep into that research um or it could just be something that's really prudent or something I'm super 
[14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=850) interested in say Okay um this supplement I had a quick note on it looked really cool let me go deeper see if it's actually worth uh testing out so anyway this is not supposed to be 
[14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=869) a catch all but it's not supposed to be hopefully it doesn't get too bloated we'll see what the future holds so I just add the field name quicknotes save it and 
[14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=889) oops that needs to be canvas I've already made a mistake trash it that's interesting so the drop down menu is 
[15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=957) appearing on the screen okay so it's tied to the quicknotes canvas and direction of I want outgoing links so that's 
[16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1010) done I believe I just have to test this out now so what I'm going to do is take I think these are all organized yeah so I'm interested in keto 
[17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1063) diet and osteoarthritis so let's say I've added this to the quick nodes canvas um let me create a group this is evidence 
[18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1099) sources and insights so now what I need is nope these I need to get my wording straight these are the quick 
[18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1130) notes so I will create a database or a DB folder called quick notes so create the folder called quicknotes 
[19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1152) um and now turn that into a database folder also called equip notes and now 
[19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1178) placeholder if you saw my demo video this is what I like to do because as I'm trying to word whatever the Insight or in this case the quick note is there just not much working space 
[19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1194) here so instead I go and make a bunch of placeholders and then I can change the title titles as I go so I'm going to make this look better maybe all right what I've notice is that 
[20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1215) these database folders they do not like being moved from window to window yep if I do this h 
[21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1273) so strange anyway I have a folder it's called quicknotes it's a database folder and now do I need to do anything else I don't think there's anything specific 
[21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1296) to do with the folder oh I'll add the file class right so what I'll have to do is come up with a template for 
[21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1310) this um probably most important is just to have the research links file class so let's create a template for 
[23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1390) see if this works I don't know if this script will actually more although it might since they're direct links we'll 
[23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1416) see again might as well look at the script oh that's the I think think I've modified this one it's the public one yeah I think this should 
[24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1465) work so luckily I don't think I need to update this script F class research links and let's make this automatically 
[24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1481) published to the website so I use a plugin called digital Garden that's what this website is Created from uh it's a 
[24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1494) free alternative to obsidian publish and it has some benefits and drawbacks compared to obsidian publish I mean one is one positive is that it's free uh the second is that it works with data view 
[25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1511) so you can see on here that if you want to trace back through any of the takeaways for example then it shows uh the scripts 
[25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1530) work um and so this these tables are created properly uh what am I saying so right I need to add that to publish 
[25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1553) these automatically or to make them automatically available for publish h okay now unfortunately that means that I jumped the gun with all of these 
[26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1601) quick notes that I just made oh that worked okay cool so it works if if I click and drag directly from the folder structure into a new window it 
[27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1620) works but if I open it in one window and drag it to another then it doesn't work anyway let oh perfect it already has it set up to read from the templates folder 
[27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1673) automatically so what I'll do is just delete need these [Music] do it again the drop down is appearing in a different window 
[29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1741) okay get rid of that there we go so I'll create a bunch of these and now add one of them 
[30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1803) okay now we're getting somewhere perfect all right so I think that's it so let me demonstrate 
[30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1839) this let's let's knock out this backlog these have been staring me in the face you I can actually boom 
[31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1894) so that's already in here let's see what do I want to store about this study how deep do I want to go the idea is that I would 
[31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1913) just be able to store something quickly so as the workflow looks right now it's actually still fairly involved I go in 
[32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1931) general I would go from my RSS feed to PubMed download that into zoto so that would extract all the metadata and then from 
[32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1953) there I copy the citation key and here as the file name I copy the citation and in an effort to organize 
[33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=1988) things better and to separate them into canvases I believe that was the original reason I started adding basically tags in different 
[33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2003) columns was because I didn't have a great way to Quick add notes I mean I do want to keep everything organized better 
[33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2016) um but I began adding uh study details so I would add it into here and then I would add the note 
[33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2032) category and what that allows for is the the DB folder plugin has a really cool really cool option to filter out or 
[34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2052) to automatically populate with files of a certain type so I've actually created 
[34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2066) nine new new DB folders you can see the organization in here uh depending on how up to date this is so if it's a no category that means that I've dedicated a new database 
[34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2083) folder to it uh for more to more easily organize the details for it so I'm interested in Diagnostics I like Imaging and blood markers nutrition orthobiologics orthobiologic treatments 
[35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2101) activities yeah different things and so I can show one of those so here's the nutrition one how did I do this 
[35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2122) yeah so in the settings you go to select the source of data datase data use a query and then you word the query in this way so for me it's from this uh location 
[35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2139) where contains this field and Link in this case it's a link to a a tag basically so if in if the folder if a note in the folder that houses these notes has this as the 
[35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2159) note category relational field value then it populates in here which is really cool 
[36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2180) so what am I getting at uh what am I doing where am I yeah so what do I want to do how did I get off on that 
[36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2216) tangent uh so this works this works now I want to get back rid of my backlog oh yeah so I was going through 
[37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2233) the workflow yeah so I would log you know the New Evidence source and then organize it and then from there I can add more study details to it so in this case um 
[37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2248) to try to narrow down because I've accumulated hundreds of studies in zoto and in an effort to narrow down 
[37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2262) exactly which ones I wanted to derive insights from now that I've got a system to do that I began organizing things and so that's where all this was going so I began organizing all the studies 
[38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2280) and then so I've been really interested in Ethan a then I can find all the Urth and a studies and derive insights from them 
[38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2295) um so that's a workflow so far so that's all to say that the workflow is actually still fairly involved but still this should be much less 
[38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2311) involved than uh tearing apart a study and deriving insid from it so let's try to get rid of this backlog here what do I want to say about this 
[38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2327) study let's get rid of all this stuff I mean really ideally I would just be looking at the abstract and in many cases especially with newer studies that's that may will often be all I have 
[39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2350) access to um yeah how would I want to do this I mean the title pretty much says it all 
[40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2407) I think the title says everything so in this case the important thing is a ketogenic diet reduces progression of ostor rtis via nlrp3 
[40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2431) inhibition so there it is I mean that's that's the key takeway from this study until I dive into it and see if it's you know if I agree with it 
[40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2449) or there's some detail that I'm not missing or that I'm not getting uh you know what I would be really interested in and tearing apart that kind of study would be what kind 
[41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2461) of BHB level did the animal stay at was there calorie restriction involved was there protein restriction involved those types of things but really I would need 
[41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2476) to tear it apart to get to get deep into that sort of those sorts of insights all right on to the next oh I don't have a 
[41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2505) PDF come back to that one don't have that PDF really helps to have the PDF oh this is funny how about 
[42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2537) I try for one more at least here we go okay so this looks like what is showing is I think the main takeaway is about 
[43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2624) forkin and ivd degeneration for yeah that's the the other part's interesting but injecting Force galin into 
[44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2681) dis actually it says local injection well I'll come back to it anyway this could be Force SCH 
[45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2718) inhibits progression of IBD to generation looks like it works it still works cool so anyway uh it looks like this new system is working 
[45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2743) um for adding quick notes so now I'll be testing it and trying to get through my backlog and uh on to the next so anyway I'm Zach this is part of my learning jour journey 
[45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuDu265CpFk&t=2757) and uh if you have any ideas let me know see you
