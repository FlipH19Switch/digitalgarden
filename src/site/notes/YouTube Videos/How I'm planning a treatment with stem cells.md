## Transcript
[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=0) all right how I'm planning a treatment with stem cells bit different than my other videos but definitely part of my Learning Journey so let's go first the disclaimer so everything 
[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=14) I'm going to discuss here is based on my personal experiences um this video is the first in what I hope to be a multi-part series documenting my experiences with regenerative medicine 
[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=27) um and it's not intended to be medical advice so all opinions in this video are my own unless otherwise noted now the overview and background so what I'm doing is planning a treatment 
[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=41) with stem cells why I'm doing it because I have accumulated some injuries that are getting progressively getting worse so these are in my back uh my neck and my 
[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=53) hips um I've seen little positive response to physical therapy I've been in and out of physical therapy um for the past couple of years and I've seen little positive response to some other 
[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=68) regenerative medicine procedures that I've had in the past year just over a year so these were platelet based therapies and Prolotherapy and I do not want surgery 
[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=82) so how I'm planning this uh I first need to find a clinic that I trust um which I've done and I'll get into then I needed to get updated 
[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=95) Imaging and then get try to establish the best Baseline for health that I can before I have any sort of procedure done I also am building objective tracking systems because as part of this 
[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=114) journey I want to be able to document objectively as many things as I can related to what I'm doing to prepare what I'm doing to uh rehab and how my symptoms change 
[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=130) throughout that process um how I'm also doing this is sorting Logistics obviously because um there will be travel involved with the stemell 
[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=144) procedure and then preparing for posttop or Pro post procedure life and sharing the journey publicly so lots of learning so far and I'm sure there will be much more in the coming 
[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=160) months and year years so I want to be sharing as much as that as poss much as much of that as possible now why share the journey well experiences with regenerative 
[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=177) medicine that are really detailed and objective are rare now everyone has some inherent bias so I'm putting work into trying 
[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=192) to remove as much bias as possible or at least um make as much of that known along the journey uh accountability so the planning the tracking and the 
[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=208) post procedure uh and then learning and feedback so again lots of learning so far there will be lots of learning um on the way and then basically feedback by putting this 
[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=221) out there I can get feedback from anyone that has had experience with regenerative medicine like this or is looking to have uh these types of procedures done um you can see exactly 
[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=235) you know what I'm doing and I'll try to explain exactly why I'm doing everything as as much as possible so if you see something that just looks really stupid or you have questions about 
[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=246) something um those are really helpful because they can basically help me make sure that I'm doing everything to the best uh best way possible so you can help me refine all 
[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=262) the you know decisions that I make and things that I'm doing it's also just an exciting and unique opportunity so I'm very fortunate to be able to do something like this 
[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=275) and um even though it's not really the best reason why I would want to do something like this it's um it is pretty exciting to be involved in the stem cell world 
[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=290) so just as a bit of History here I used to work in a stem cell lab in Louisville so um I work for Dr Mario RAC and he and his team back in 2006 they were the first to characterize a 
[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=309) population of stem cells called very small embryonic like stem cells the research that I did during my PhD was um Loosely related to that it wasn't directly on the stem cells but it was 
[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=323) related in what's called epigenetics so I was looking at the epigenetics of a cancer uh type of cancer that is possibly related to V 
[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=336) cells and I was saying where the epigenetics were similar and different more or less so anyway but I was working there during a time when they were in the middle of a big discovery about how 
[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=350) to actually get those stem cells to proliferate or divide and so all this is to say the past 10 years I've maintained a pretty active obsession with stem cells in 
[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=362) general so now having the opportunity to actually get treatment with stem cells is um pretty exciting all the planning and doing the research behind it and 
[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=374) trying to optimize you know for a stem cell procedure is um I think it's kind of a fun challenge so current state of the 
[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=385) journey uh finding a clinic basically I've made this Choice already I'm going with regenx Cayman um there are lots of clinics popping up as I understand it all over especially 
[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=399) Central South America um and then clinics that claim to be stem cell clinics in the US and then clinics that treat people with uh bone marrow aspirate bone marrow 
[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=410) concentrate in the US which does contain some stem cells but I've chosen regenx Cayman they are I'm not exactly sure where the line is drawn between regenex and regenx Cayman I understand that 
[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=425) they're distinct entities but as far as I understand all of the Physicians that work at regenx Cayman either are in the regenx network or were in the regenx network 
[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=441) so it's like two overlapping circles and I'm not sure exactly you know where one ends and where the other begins so anyway a lot of what I understand about regenex 
[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=454) Cayman comes from regenx content now renix came in does have uh a Blog I believe they have a YouTube channel um and then doctors that that uh work at the clinic have 
[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=471) scientific Publications around this type of procedure so um treatments with bone marrow derived autologous ex culture expanded stem cells um so all that content you know 
[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=488) when I was I began looking for this type of treatment a year just just over a year ago so when I started getting really into it and looking on YouTube and 
[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=500) trying to understand exactly what was available um I came across regenics content pretty quickly and out of all the content that I've come across they that content has really struck me 
[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=513) as um being very transparent um being very research-based in that in most of the blogs um or basically anytime I saw any sort of scientific claim made it almost 
[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=531) always had um some sort of research some citation to support it and I thought okay this this is unique um this makes it seem really trustworthy I can if I want to I can go 
[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=546) and check and see if I agree with whatever claims that they're being whatever claims are being made um and then in the YouTube content as well from regenex and basically when I say regenex 
[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=558) here almost all this content comes from Dr Ceno now the regenex came in blog I'm not sure exactly who writes all those blog articles but uh Dr stino has written I believe all of the blog 
[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=573) articles I haven't checked each and every one but on the regenx site um I would guess that he's written all of them um and then he runs a YouTube channel again where one ends and you 
[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=589) know where his YouTube channel ends and where regenx begins I'm not exactly sure because I've only seen him make content about Regin X related things or regenx Cayman related things so anyway all this 
[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=603) is say in this big bubble of regenx regenx Cayman Dr centeno um and regenx doctors there is a lot of content available and that helps give me confidence in their abilities to 
[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=622) treat this type of these types of issues that I'm having um now regenics Cayman also uses aus stem cells um this means that the stem cells come from me so the way that they do it 
[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=635) is um take two trips down to the Cayman Islands the first will be for an in-person consultation to try to get a better understanding of exactly 
[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=647) what's going on exactly what the pain generators are um exactly what the root cause is for the symptoms that I'm having and then they'll do a bone marrow aspiration 
[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=660) and uh then I'll come back four six some number of weeks later to actually have the culture expanded stem cells implanted back into whatever areas I need them so they'll take the bone Mar 
[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=678) aspirate and from that culture the existing stem cells from the bone Mar aspirate and they'll expand in numbers um and then have many more stem cells available when I on the return trip 
[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=693) so another reason I'm choosing reenix Cayman is because I've had positive experiences with the sentino Schultz Clinic um with just the way they operate again when I was looking 
[11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=708) for my initial dive into regener regenerative medicine I chose the Ceno Schultz Clinic because of you know in large part this cont content that was out there I 
[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=720) could um it made sense to me what Dr stino was saying um when I met with uh Dr money through the in-person consult over Zoom so I guess not inperson but the zoom 
[12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=735) consult and then uh in person when I traveled out there I've had just a great experience with working with him um I haven't had the results that I wanted obviously but the experience with their 
[12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=748) team the way they operate um yeah that that really played a big part in choing regenix came in as well um honestly I I've been looking at stem cells for over you know again over a 
[12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=764) year and had looked at regenix came in at that point as well um but didn't want to dive all the way into the stem cell region just yet so 
[12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=779) well come to think of it um yeah it's a long story so anyway another reason is that amongst all of the available clinics this is one where English is the native language so that 
[13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=794) makes me more comfortable traveling there and uh because I've never been to the Cayman Islands before um just knowing that I'll be able to get around without 
[13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=808) having to try to to translate a lot of language is uh that's a relief so so I found the clinic um also the scientific articles these are the ones that I was me talking about so these 
[13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=823) specifically you can see Dr stino was on uh both of these These are treating um well this was a case report uh but this was a full study on the use of these culture 
[13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=838) expanded autologus um bone Mar derive stem cells on dis bulges so they are documenting their experience and patient outcomes in the uh lumbar 
[14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=851) spine now this isn't peer- reviewed but I it I also find this very valuable um this is one of Dr stino's blog posts on the origin X blog uh you can see it's all the way back from 
[14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=867) 2014 so this is you know 10 years ago and you can see if you click into the PDF on the website you can see before and after MRIs with uh dis bulges and they also have summ 
[14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=882) summaries of people's um outcomes so again I think this speaks to the transparency it's not peer reviewed unfortunately it it would have been great if these results 
[14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=896) were um you know in the other Publications for example if these Publications came with MRI before an after results like this that would have been 
[15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=909) fantastic um but this is I guess the next best thing so haven't seen a large group of these sorts of before and after photos anywhere else um happy to be wrong there so if anybody has come 
[15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=924) across this sort of thing from other clinics I'd love to see it but so far this is the only one that I found now next on the list of uh things part of the planning for this is Imaging 
[15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=941) so before I was even in conversation with reinx came in I got a DEA scan um because I was just curious mainly about if I had um any issues with well I wanted to know if my bone 
[15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=957) mineral density um how that was because I haven't been able to do strenuous exercise in a couple of years um and I was specifically curious about bone uh mineral density in my 
[16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=970) lumbar spine and I also wanted to know about you know body fat percentage how much lean mass I still had that sort of thing so I got a Dexter scan and then after my initial consult with Dr Pitts 
[16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=982) on the phone um while he was down at reenix came in uh I guess got a lumbar MRI since then and then I also got something called a 
[16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=993) digital motion x-ray recently um this was interesting so this was to investigate if if uh if cranial cervical instability could be playing a role in any of my symptoms 
[16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1010) so um this was even though it doesn't appear that uh the results from this don't really show cranio cervical instability to the degree that it would need the 
[17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1025) specialized treatment that they offer to my knowledge only at the uh cenno Schultz Clinic um called a pic which I can't remember what that stands for but anyway um this did show 
[17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1040) some valuable information at least valuable to me uh we'll see what you know if it needs to be treated or not um about um retrolisthesis and anoesis um in the cervical spine so 
[17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1054) anyway this was an interesting type of Imaging uh that I had done recently so I can give more information on that if anybody's interested now diet fasting and health 
[17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1068) metrics um so let's see I'm on a ketogenic diet I've been on a ketogenic diet since 2018 I had a period where I was close to carnivore it was like carnivore plus 
[18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1087) Quest products I ate a lot of quest cookies and things like that also drink energy drinks and stuff but um so anyway I'm on a ketogenic diet uh I wanted to resolve some stomach issues and then 
[18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1100) some foot issues basically do anything that felt like a health issue I wanted to have it checked out and if it was an issue get it resolved before actually going down and getting 
[18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1113) the bone Mar aspiration so uh I believe I've resolved both of these things to the degree that you know I'm comfortable with um or understand 
[18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1126) more about them uh foot issues was just tonal fungus now fast mimicking diets this is something uh again I'll make I'm planning to make a 
[19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1141) video to go in depth as to why I do uh this sort of fasting and then why I'm really interested in ketogenic diets um specifically for the potential impact on stem 
[19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1155) cells um but I want to get at least one more fast mimicking diet in before the bone Mar aspiration um then getting supplements down you know what exactly am I supplementen 
[19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1168) regimen is going to look like now uh immediately after the procedure in the future if that even changes that sort of thing and then blood testing as part of just understanding exactly where I am at 
[19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1181) the moment I just recently had another complete blood count with metabolic panel um Iron panel uh High sensitivity C reactive protein um various hormones and uh 
[19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1197) recently vitamins like vitam Vin C and vitamin D so just trying to understand exactly where I'm starting and if anything is not 
[20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1208) looking the way I want it to if there's anything I can do about it before um the bone Mar aspiration I want to take action now and try to resolve it so what is this this 
[20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1223) is right some of the research yeah if you're interested in the fasting I'm trying to put together it's an ongoing process but I'm putting together the evidence base 
[20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1235) behind as many decisions that I make as possible um so when it comes to different types of fasting that includes uh in this case fast mimicking diet um this is just one example of something I 
[20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1248) call takeaways if you go to my website then you can check out the various takeaways I'm coming up with again if you've seen any of my other videos you're probably familiar with exactly 
[20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1259) how I arrive at these but um yeah you can see what progress I'm making there uh and then I'll be working on that research system as well to try to integrate um actions and outcomes so 
[21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1274) basically tying the takeaways I get from the research to actions I can take that can help achieve some outcome so um that's all work in progress it will probably be a 
[21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1287) work in progress for a long time but uh that's where I'm trying to store everything now objective tracking systems this one is a this is fun so well to some degree it's also kind of 
[21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1303) frustrating um I've been tracking food for the past like basically every single thing I've eaten for almost two years now um and I've been doing it in Google Sheets instead of something like my 
[21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1314) fitness pal and really the reason is because I have much more control over the information um and I can work with the information in ways that uh just in more 
[22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1328) creative ways I'm sure you can download information from my fitness pal and work with it that way but um I like this Hands-On approach so anyway I've got a tracking system down 
[22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1341) for nutrition um it can be improved but I think it's in a decent stage right now I'm also tracking exercise and I may or may not make this public and then the big one is symptom tracking this one is 
[22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1356) a major challenge right now but it's arguably the most important of these in terms of the treatment be because I want it to help me understand if something is changing over time 
[22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1371) um it can be very difficult to stay subjective about this and you know if you you've ever filled out like a pain questionnaire I haven't found one yet that I'm really confident in in terms of 
[23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1388) something I could use daily um and really be confident in say whatever I'm putting down now versus when I'm recording in say six months if they're if I could be confident in 
[23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1402) whatever changes may or may not have taken place um on paper between those two time points so that's a big work in progress and that's a a big Focus right 
[23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1414) now so when it comes to nutrition I've already published this on my website if you want to you can just jump into nutrition log this is open um you can click on whatever metric you know this 
[23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1426) pop down uh this drop down list I've got you know vitamins minerals different active ingredients um you can see my caffeine intake over the past almost two years 
[23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1439) years uh so it's on a weekly trailing average right now um and I could put different stuff out there this just seemed like the best one to get started with so I've also got the 
[24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1456) food database if you want to go and see um I don't know why people would but you see what foods I'm eating uh the food database that's another reason why I wanted to go I mean under the umbrella 
[24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1468) of reasons why I wanted to go with my own tracking system was so I can have more confidence in the actual information being used so um like on my fitness pal you can select from 
[24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1482) it's been a while since I've used it but last time I used it you could select from different variations of the same food and then you could put in your Gram amount or 
[24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1491) whatever and I'm just not that confident in the information um and so by building one myself I'm able to track exactly what references I'm using for specific vitamins minerals that may the 
[25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1506) information may be missing from a nutrition label or from um from the fda's Food Central database you know that offers a a lot of great information but sometimes 
[25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1519) different vitamins minerals or other active ingredients are missing so so anyway I'm working on making as much of my food database public as well and this is where I am with the symptom 
[25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1533) tracking so uh this is a fun challenge I'm playing around with oama so llama 3.1 uh running it locally and using the web UI open web UI interface so I just got 
[25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1553) this up and running within maybe the past week uh but the idea is I'd like to be able to to speak into my phone have a generate an audio recording and then feed that into 
[26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1566) olama and have some bot spit out a CV or a CSV file that actually puts all the relevant information into different fields so like these are three example audio files that I created um just to 
[26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1584) play with it so you know recorded some audio file uh talking about symptoms I'm experiencing in the moment and organizing the way I talk about it 
[26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1598) to make it easy for the bot to transcribe it and then identify what information goes where and it did a pretty good job so like in one of the files I said okay I've got a 
[26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1610) headache it's in the the middle intensity one uh maybe it's because of a weird position a bit um blah blah blah back pain different places so it did a pretty good 
[27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1621) job extracting the information the issue I'm running into right now is that I want the timestamp of the original source to be here instead of user one and I can't get the 
[27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1636) bot to actually tell me what the names of these files are so I even ask it what file names that you use to get the information and it tell it shows the exact files right here where I got the 
[27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1649) information I list them in the citations but it doesn't have any files to reference so that's where I am there hopefully I'll be able to solve this relatively quickly and begin testing it 
[27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1661) because I want to establish as good of an objective Baseline as I can now before even getting the bone marrow aspiration because at the bone marrow aspiration 
[27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1675) that's when um the inperson consult will be so I'd like to bring as much information to that consult as possible and so if I can build a history of you know multi 
[28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1688) multiple times a day checking in creating these audio files having this bot spit out this data and I can begin analyzing the data then I have much more objective information to give to the 
[28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1703) physician to help make an informed decision about what should be treated now obviously ultimately it's it's up to the physician and I'll Trust their opinion um or if I don't then I just 
[28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1718) won't have the procedure but um whatever treatment happens will be up to them so I want to give them as much information I want to be as good of a patient as I can and come as informed as I can and 
[28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1734) give them as much information as they need to decide what the best treatment would be now Logistics so I've had the initial phone consult with Dr pittz um that went 
[29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1751) really well uh now I am in the stages of planning the first trip I don't know exactly when this will be um I should 
[29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1764) know probably within the next two weeks what date uh what dates that'll be and then I'm not sure exactly when I'll schedule the follow-up procedure it 
[29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1776) may be before the initial consult it may be at the time of the initial uh in-person consult um that's yet to be determined now I'm also preparing for post-procedure life 
[29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1791) and this is a big part of the entire thing this is one of the most important aspects is to make sure that my day-to-day life is going to be whatever help that I need I'm going 
[30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1809) to organize that beforehand so um so probably just be asking family to help out with you know probably even little 
[30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1826) things uh due to lifting restrictions so I don't know exactly what the post-procedure um recommendations are but if if the post-procedure recommendations from The PRP and 
[30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1839) Prolotherapy procedures um are anything to use to gauge this then can be pretty restrictive for a while so I need to get down I need to record all the things I 
[30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1855) do in a day that could compromise the outcome of of the procedure if I do them too quickly and either find a way around them for the you know initial time where 
[31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1869) there's going to be heavy restrictions or go ahead and ask somebody to be there uh and help me out with them when I need that help so a lot of this is going to be like food prep 
[31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1883) um taking care of the cat so um yeah you know it's just day-to-day activities and then understand you know what exercise restrictions how to progress with that 
[31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1900) uh let's see so when to get back into Physical Therapy what kind of exercises I can do outside Physical Therapy how to get into 
[31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1912) those when to get into those that kind of thing and another big one because there will likely be a neck well I don't know for sure but um there may be some neck involvement in 
[32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1928) everything that's going on and so there may be neck um procedure how's it going to change the way I sleep like well I need to just have more 
[32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1943) pillows around to to try to ensure that I can always find a comfortable we'll see what's this going to be like so anyway I need to play around with that 
[32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1956) um so all that is going into the planning um my current priorities are to actually schedule the first trip I want to get at least one fast mimicking diet in 
[32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1970) before the trip I want to create and test this system for tracking symptoms and I want to get all of the major details sorted for the post-procedural life uh those 
[33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=1986) are the current priorities obviously in the background I'd like to make more videos um on my research system and actually demonstrations or just live research with me type videos um 
[33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=2001) documenting you know my thought process why um well one with regards to like V cells and ketogenic diet fasting I want to document that 
[33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=2015) uh I want to get more information down or more of the ideas down around um why I'm doing fasting uh and the potential drawbacks of fasting I've got I don't know a big 
[33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=2031) one there is what I was actually doing these regular fast mimicking diets once a month maybe three months in a row and then I stopped after I got the dexa um because 
[34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=2044) I wasn't sure if the fast mimicking diet could actually be having a negative impact on my bone mineral density I don't know for sure so I need to look deeper into 
[34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=2055) that um yeah so lots of ideas and basically yeah lots of video ideas um but these are the main things as far as planning goes so with 
[34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=2069) that I'm Zach this is part of my Learning Journey if you have any questions um or yeah any questions or you see something that I'm planning and you 
[34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFW4G27Knk&t=2082) don't think it's a good idea or you just have any thoughts in general I'm all yours and uh don't know exactly when the next part in the series will be but hopefully soon so until next time
