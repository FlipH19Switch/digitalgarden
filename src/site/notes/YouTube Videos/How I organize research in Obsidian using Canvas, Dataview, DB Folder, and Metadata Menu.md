## Transcript (YTranscript Obsidian Plugin)
[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=0) this is a walkthrough video for the system that I currently use to organize all the research that I come across and the insights and takeaways that I come away from the research with so it's 
[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=13) using a free not taking app called obsidian if you haven't heard of obsidian again it's free and I out of all the note-taking apps that I've come across it is the most enabling so far 
[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=28) for this kind of task uh because of the way I can visualize things and Link pages together um all in the same place so I'll get to that in a 
[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=43) bit basically I'm calling the system Atomic research so you may have heard of atomic note taking or Atomic thinking basically this system enables me to get very granular with the individual logic 
[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=56) steps that I take when going from Individual res studies to takeaways so I use it because I can visualize all the logic steps and at the end once I've created takeaways I can 
[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=76) trace back through those links that I've created between pages and find the original source for whatever or source is for whatever was used to create the takeaway 
[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=91) so if you want to use this system you'll need obsidian with these plugins and zoto with this plugin so you'll definitely need obsidian with uh data view DB folder and metadata menu 
[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=105) those three plugins now the other ones are optional but I highly recommend templator and simple canvas search um and then zoto is the uh reference manager that I use and 
[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=119) it works really well for this because it's got a citation um key Creator called better biit Tex as a free plugin so anyway obsidian is free zoto is free and better 
[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=132) bitex is free all these plugins all this stuff is free so um I recommend all this now there are some scripts that I also recommend these are very simple to use all this is going to seem very 
[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=147) daunting uh at the beginning if you've never used obsidian before but I'll walk through each and every step exactly how to use the scripts and how to navigate all the plugins set everything up uh to 
[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=159) make sure that it's going to be working correctly if you'd like to use it so the first step is to install and enable the community plugins so in 
[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=171) obsidian to move this up a bit you go down to the settings gear and then go go into Community plugins you can browse select a plugin to 
[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=186) install and then you want to install and enable it so you'll see options to enable and disable and now I'll go into the individual settings so again you'll need 
[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=199) data view DB folder and metadata menu Advanced slides you don't need that's just for recording this video and then in data view these are all the settings many of these are stock the only one 
[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=212) that is necessary to change is to enable JavaScript queries so make sure that is on everything else should be stock there in DB folder I have stickied the First Column 
[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=230) that's just personal preference same with created date modified date and then I've added a folder for templates which those will be very uh important later on I highly recommend 
[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=243) using templates for this it makes the whole process uh much easier and I like to increase the number of rows for each table and then decrease the font size a 
[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=257) bit everything else should be stock and then in metadata menu will go through everything but the only piece that needs to be changed 
[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=270) is in file class settings so what you need to do is create a folder for the class files we'll need to create one class file uh for all of this to work so there 
[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=284) needs to be a folder for it and what you'll notice is as soon as you create this folder I'll show it in just a second um other than that everything else is stock 
[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=297) you can see there now I've named this folder classes and I've left this file name the field Alias as file class so 
[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=310) this classes folder whatever yours is named you'll notice that it has a an purple icon with a plus sign and that allows you to create a new file class within the 
[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=324) folder so there's also simple canvas search I did not turn this on and then templator all I did was create a folder for the templates everything else should be 
[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=340) stock all right now add at least one new database folder so the way I have this set up is I have one folder for research and then within there I have five different types of folders one is to 
[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=355) hold the assumptions that I make one is to hold all of the insights that I uh draw from the research one is to hold the source content that would be like the graphs 
[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=368) all the um text that I copy and paste from Individual evidence sources and then I have one for studies that's just one type of evidence source so I have one database folder 
[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=382) specifically for that and then takeaways has there's a folder for that as well now once you have at least one database folder 
[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=393) created actually I forgot a step you need to rightclick on that folder and create new database folder so it won't create a new folder what that will do is turn this into a database folder 
[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=408) and it will create a page with a table like this now for each of the tables what I recommend doing is actually we'll do we'll do that in the next step 
[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=421) uh okay for now create a canvas so what I've done is created a folder called canvases and then I've added a blank canvas and added some stuff to it so now we need 
[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=436) to add a class so click on the plus icon and create a class and then go into file class Fields create a new one and give it a 
[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=461) name and it has to be canvas so has to be the specific type and the reason is this will allow us to connect pages together in a canvas just using the 
[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=475) arrow so select canvas and then select the path of the canvas that's why you need to have a canvas made already whatever canvas you if you've have more than one they should 
[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=488) all show up here so just select the one you want to use for um creating the links between these items and now very important is to 
[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=499) select outgoing so this is really important for the system because this is how the scripts will work to trace back through links to find the original source 
[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=510) for whatever takeaways you are creating and then click save down at the bottom the check mark okay and now add content so what I've 
[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=524) done already is added some stuff into this canvas I've added and actually I need to bring this up so can right click and then create 
[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=542) group and so I've created several groups already I've created one giant group to hold everything and then I've created a source group Source cont content group insights and then over here I've created 
[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=574) one for takeaways and assumptions uh inside of another group so what this helps with is to visualize as you go from left to right across the canvas 
[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=588) that's basically going from the original Source up to the takeaways and now to add more content the way I recommend doing this 
[10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=604) is to start with the source so in this case it would be to add a study into the studies tab here or into the studies folder you can do this a couple of different ways you 
[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=618) can click add within the table and then select the template that you want to use for the study or you can rightclick on the folder itself and click if you use the templat or 
[10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=632) Plugin then you can create new note from template which you can't see actually so if you right click on the folder create new note from template then it will let you select the template 
[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=647) you want to use so in this case I have created a study from the evidence sources template that I have you can see that I've got a folder for templates these are the templates that I use 
[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=661) and we'll take a look at each of those as well but for now this is why I like to use zoto and the better bibtex plugin so if we look at zoto 
[11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=684) then when you click on a study in in zoto as long you're using the plugin then you'll see citation key at the top right so that's what I use for file names here and then I will copy in the 
[11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=699) citation also ni and zotter you can right click on something create bibliography select the type select copy to clipboard click okay and then can paste that into a text field 
[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=715) here so to create fields click on that plus icon and then select the type of field that you want to create and in this case I've added a 
[12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=728) text field called citation and then most importantly and you want to do this for each of the databases that you're using in the canvas uh whatever files you're using in 
[12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=740) the canvas whatever databases that those belong to you want to add a file class field and to do that you want to add file 
[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=758) class as a select field and what that will allow you to do is to add go into settings and then add labels and values to be selected so in my case the 
[12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=775) reason mine is called file class is within the metadata menu settings in the file class settings I left this as stock I didn't change this and so by default it's called file class 
[13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=788) so I would just take this copy it and then add that as a select column and what that will do is that will automatically give the column ID the name of file class as 
[13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=806) well and then the actual class that I'm using so I've added several new classes um but for all the stuff in the canvas mine is using the file class research links so I would 
[13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=823) want to add an option down here that's why these are research links so what you would do is whatever your file class is named paste that in Click add and then you can double check that it worked by 
[13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=838) going uh leaving settings and coming back and you'll see it down at the bottom so that allows you to select research links or whatever your file class is 
[14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=850) named and what that allows is for the whole system to work that will enable you to whatever file has that file class in the canvas whatever you point you uh connect it to something 
[14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=867) else with an arrow it will add that page that you connected it to add a link to it in the front matter as a property uh in the file itself so 
[14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=883) demonstrate that just a minute so what I would do is basically start from the left side of the canvas and then add things going to the right so in this case I've added a 
[14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=895) source already I added that study and the next step would be to add Source content so the way that I've got this system set 
[15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=906) up is I can click within an individual study so you can go into the table and you can click on it or you can navigate over to the file uh filing system and click on it 
[15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=919) there but I set up the page to hold content from the study itself so this is nice because it means that I don't have to leave obsidian to look at any of the uh study materials I 
[15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=934) can just copy and paste them into a page in obsidian and always have them for reference so the way I can reference them is once I've copied and paste the 
[15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=945) stuff inside of here as long as I've sectioned it off so I've called this section figure 2T because that's what I've put in here maybe if it was a method section I could uh copy and paste 
[15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=958) text from the methods and then add a new header and then paste the text in there the important thing is that it's got a header because that enables you to link 
[16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=975) directly to this material this content from another page so we can see that in if we go back to the canvas The Next Step would be to add Source content and so to to do that you can go to the 
[16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=990) source content table and then add something new select a template to add it from or to use and I've already done that and what I've done 
[16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1003) is I've added this link so I've embedded a link so from the study itself I'll just go back I'll grab the name and so basically I've added content into the 
[17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1020) study page and now I want to be able to reference that content as a unique page itself and then link it back to the study or link out from the study to the content it all makes sense here in a bit 
[17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1035) so what I've done is just copied this name the file name because I like to use that as a point of reference inside of the source content so I have used that as part of the title here and then 
[17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1050) called it figure 2T because I want to create a page specifically for that figure inside of obsidian so now inside of this page the specific to figure 2T in that 
[17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1063) study I want to embed material from that other page so exclamation point and then uh two brackets and then you paste the the name 
[17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1079) of the study and then add a hashtag by adding a hashtag it allows you to select a section that you want to reference or embed from the other page so I want to 
[18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1091) embed figure 2T so now I can come to this page and see figure 2T and not have to try to find it inside of here I could just use this study page 
[18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1104) to log all the content inside of this uh from the study that I think is important or that I want to reference later and then create unique Pages for each one of them 
[18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1114) individually you'll see other stuff in here assumptions original Source I'll go into that a bit later what's important now is just that at this step of the process we have created a page for the 
[18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1126) study and we have derived content from the study we've we've added content from the study into obsidian and we've created a unique page specifically for that cont content 
[19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1140) now this is the one of the really cool Parts about obsidian I'll just get rid of some of this uh stuff I did before and we will look at this individual page so right now 
[19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1158) you'll see that this is empty and for this page you'll see that same area in the front matter is empty but now as soon as I draw an arrow between these 
[19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1175) two you see that this one has that connection as a link I can click on it and go to that page don't worry about this it's just got to do with 
[19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1189) uh the table that I set up but we see that this page does not have that link because it's being linked to it's there's an outgoing 
[20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1203) link from here to here that's why it's so important when you create this class they select outgoing so the link goes this way it appears in here it does not appear in 
[20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1215) here and that's really nice when we want to backtrack through all of the links using scripts to find the original sources so at this stage I've got a source I've got some Source content I've 
[20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1232) connected them together and now I want to add some insights that I derived from that Source content so in this case it's a graph uh looking at mezen 
[20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1244) kiml stem progenitor cells and their brdu incorporation so it's uh it's a way to try to measure uh proliferation in in cells and is 
[21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1261) comparing some fasting groups to con uh fasting group to some control groups so I've got some just insights that I've derived from this I've got some thoughts on it like okay well from this graph it 
[21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1275) looks like the mouse fasting mimicking diet increases brdo incorporation into the stem cells okay and then I've got some other Insight that could draw from the same graph from one graph or piece 
[21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1287) of content or whatever could derive multiple insights um but now the cool part is that you can connect them together so we'll say from 
[21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1297) this one graph I've derived multiple insights and we can double check that everything worked correctly so you can open this up you can see that it is connected without 
[21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1310) outgoing links to those two pages and these Pages have nothing they're not connect Ed to anything but because of the code that I've added to this 
[22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1326) area it does recognize that a source content page is being connected to this so it's looking backwards through that link and seeing that okay there is some Source content 
[22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1341) that is being used as the evidence for this Insight that's really how to interpret this these are basically your um layers of evidence for the insight and then you can get 
[22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1358) very deep with these insights you can say okay well these two insights are unique but they can actually be combined to create a more detailed Insight uh or essentially a 
[22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1372) more um broad Insight something that could be that is um you have have a bit less confidence in in and of itself maybe but it allows you to be more flexible with what you can uh derive 
[23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1390) from it so for example in this case this is specifically looking at Mouse stem cells maybe this Insight is about human stem cells so could say 
[23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1404) that the fmd increases uh brdu incorporation into humans themselves now it's taking quite a leap but could still potentially make that as an 
[23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1418) insight as long as you log assumptions about it say okay well I don't know for sure that that's the case but I'm going to hypothesize that so you can even word it that way 
[23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1432) you could say uh fasting mimicking diet may increase brdu Incorporation into human cells human stem cells so it's perfectly fine to make uh draw that conclusion that possibility or 
[24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1448) hypothesize but in that case you would want to add an assumption or probably a lot of assumptions because that's quite a leap that you're taking uh with that kind of 
[24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1460) clae so can add one assumption you can make another assumption the purpose or the benefit here is that whatever logic jumps or logic steps you're taking along the 
[24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1474) way to essentially to make this data usable in other ways so there's lots of insights you can create directly from the data but maybe you're interested in fasting you're thinking maybe uh okay 
[24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1489) well there's no human data to say that stem cells are definitely going to proliferate um after a fast but there is some mouse data how do I log all of my thinking behind the possibility that the 
[25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1506) mouse data could translate to humans and so that's what this sort of thinking um really enables you to do is to log that process and especially log all the assumptions that you make along the way 
[25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1519) because sometimes the assumptions are very very uh big or they're basically they illustrate very big big questions that exist or knowledge gaps in the research 
[25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1532) itself so when you uh this assumption I actually made inside the assumptions database already so new assumption about um bone marom and kindless dim 
[25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1547) cells and I've already added it into here so it was available for me to link to but if I want to make another assumption then I can do this very quickly 
[25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1558) by right clicking on the assumptions folder adding a new note from template I would select the assumptions template and then I would give it a title of whatever I 
[26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1571) want to assume so this is new assumption about whatever now I copy that title go back to the canvas and you can't see it so I'll bring this up you 
[26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1587) select drag to add note from Vault and I will drag it into you can drag it in anywhere and then paste the file you actually want to add the title and then 
[26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1601) personally I would move it into the assumptions group now these groups don't have any actual functions right now I've seen some people get really creative with as soon as a note gets dragged into 
[26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1614) a group you can use metadata menu to automatically add information into the front matter like add a group or a tag or um I don't know all the possibilities but it it seems 
[27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1626) that there are a lot so you can get very creative there but for the purposes of the system as it or for the how the system is currently set up I don't have any of that other extra uh functionality 
[27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1640) right now let's say I want to have you know this is a big logic leap right to say that whatever is happening in the mouse stim cells um I I I think it's going to 
[27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1653) be the same in human stim cells I want to probably log a lot of assumptions along the way so I would want to connect a lot of assumptions to this page and then we can look at the page and we can 
[27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1663) see that those assumptions are created and because of the bit of code that I've added it looks at all the outgoing links and sees which ones are assumptions and then logs them uh and list them here for 
[27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1679) you so you can probably see where this is going you can get as intricate you can create tons of insights you can link them all together and essentially set up 
[28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1692) a hierarchy or just a series of steps between whatever sources and Source content you've got in obsidian and ultimately link it to takeaways you've taken from the research 
[28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1708) and perhaps most importantly you've logged the assumptions you make along the way so the logic steps are super important obviously uh because they are like breadcrumbs you can come back to 
[28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1722) this at any time and you should be able to follow the logic that you used to come to some conclusion or some hypothesis but the assumptions are really I think um an overlooked aspect 
[29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1740) of research that people may talk around but there are so many assumptions embedded in all kinds of like in basically every study you know you look at the discussion 
[29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1753) section and see if you completely agree with whatever they have said about the result section and they may change the wording to acknowledge that some things are assumptions um 
[29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1770) but I guess the big Point here is that in any interpretation of data or using data to take some Next Step many assumptions are embedded along the way or accumulated along the way and so it's 
[29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1787) important to log those in my opinion so and now with the templates we can take a look at each individual template that I've got if you want to set it up the same way so if we 
[30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1801) start at the beginning um evidence sources so I've got a place for content and then a section for assumptions inside there if you use back 
[30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1814) ticks you can um when you're using data view you can do three back ticks data view JS and then DV View and in parentheses the file you want to link to and so this is called linked assumptions 
[30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1829) and that goes to uh basically that references the link assumptions. jscript and this is the script for it and then it's got database fields at the very end 
[30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1847) so you may remember that in data view I may have pointed this out I may not have sorry in DB folder I like the position of new inline fields to be at the bottom so by default 
[31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1865) DB folder will put these at the very top and so what that means is when you create a table and you create a file and then you begin adding um fields that link to other databases 
[31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1882) relation fields or there may be other ways that it does it but basically as it creates new inline Fields it will add those information at 
[31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1894) the top so I'll create one right now maybe we wanted to create a relation field uh to this is Source content so maybe studies if I created a relation 
[31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1916) field and then added something you'll see that that's now added to the bottom if we didn't select bottom in the DB folder settings this 
[32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1933) would end up at the top so I've SE I've set up each of the templates to have database fields at the uh as an actual heading and it's at the bottom so that it just 
[32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1951) shows that whatever appears down here is some database field and basically to ignore it um anyway so that is evidence sources got the assumptions here and then we go to Source content we've got 
[32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1965) content also this is where we embed stuff um also have the same assumptions code being uh used there and then this is different code this is original sources another 
[33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1981) script that is here and I'll make all these scripts available on my blog if you want to use them yourself so then there are assumptions doesn't uh doesn't have 
[33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=1995) any outgoing links to it I guess I could log all of the things that are linked to an assumption but right now I just don't think that's super important 
[33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2010) but in insights we've got the assumptions code then we've got supporting insights because in the insights folder there will be all of the insights and some of them are linked to 
[33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2021) each other in basically uh to set up a hierarchy so this will look through and find whatever um insights directly support the inside being created so that is this 
[33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2038) code supporting insights here and then at the end we've got takeaways so takeaways can have assumptions added to them uh they will have insights that directly support them 
[34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2053) and then this will Trace back to find the original sources and database fields at the bottom all right so that illustrates how the system works 
[34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2066) and just to illustrate finally uh if we used two insights as support for this Insight then we would see both of 
[34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2083) those in here both insides up here and then if um yeah so anyway that should should illustrate this system well enough and I think we can go on to looks like this is 
[35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2105) reset so we have added content and now avoiding issues so when you play around with this um you might notice some potential issues or you 
[35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2122) might come across some issues so how to avoid these uh issues that I have found are you know if you've used obsidian before you probably know this but don't delete all the hashtags of a heading if 
[35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2136) you are embedding it so in here I have linked specifically to figure 2T in 
[35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2149) here if I completely got rid of these hashtags then it won't be able to find that reference 
[36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2165) anymore or if I kept the hashtags but I named it something else then this won't be able to find it anymore I'll have to change the name there as well so just something to 
[36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2184) keep in mind again if you've used a obsidian before you probably know all this stuff what else is there we've got don't add commas or quotation marks 
[36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2207) to titles okay quotation marks will break the whole thing uh basically say this link right here if this had quotation marks in it 
[37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2222) actually we can play with this if I added a quotation mark here like this this completely breaks I don't understand why um but as you can see 
[37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2246) this is the what it looks like in Source mode having those quotation marks here I can only guess that it's because quotation marks are important for the 
[37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2260) way that things are linked here uh but anyway that will break it so you got to get rid of these and if you do run into that issue then believe you have to come back and 
[37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2276) fix this manually now it works again commas if you add commas into the name what I found so far is that so I said titles but it's really 
[38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2300) file name um if you add a comma then what that will break is this column and this column isn't working for whatever reason right now I don't know why but uh what 
[38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2315) I've done is if you add a column a text column by the same name as the select item so research links text column called research Links at least how it is working in my 
[38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2333) main Vault it will take the list of it items here and show it inside of the table as a list of items but if you have a commment in the file name then it will 
[39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2346) instead of showing links it will just show titles and it looks like a mess so anyway it's not working here you can try it uh try adding text column and see if it works for you but if you do get it to 
[39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2358) work just realize that commas in the file names will break that make it look weird now probably the biggest issue here well outside of the quotation marks 
[39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2375) is that the canvas linking things within the canvas if you notice any slowdown at all stop 
[39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2389) linking and in fact whatever you had just if you had just linked something go and double check that the link was actually added inside of the page so what I found is 
[40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2400) that if I'm it's it really seems like if I'm using if I have too many tabs open or windows open or whatever that are all using data view then data view can get 
[40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2413) overloaded obsidian gets overloaded and if you continue to create links inside the canvas data view will not actually create those links between the pages I don't understand it it could be a 
[40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2426) metadata a menu issue I really don't know but what I'm finding is that if obsidian is giving a hint that it is lagging just pause give a time to catch up make sure the last thing you did that 
[40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2440) involved uh those links actually work give it time to catch up or restart obsidian and then go back to your work whatever you do don't continue adding links inside the canvas uh or if you do 
[40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2454) make sure they're actually adding um inside the pages themselves which again is really easy because you can as soon as you add a link between 
[41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2469) notes you can just open it up and double check that whatever you link you created in the canvas was actually linked here as well all right I think 
[41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2481) that are the main that is the main set of issues I've come across yeah so a general overview of the system just to wrap it up um the benefits are the visibility you can look at all the 
[41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2496) logic steps and the assumptions that you make along the way and um it enables you to get very granular with it and I'm finding that it's helping me think through all the logic steps and really 
[41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2508) make sure that they're uh they make sense that they are I have confidence in them if I don't have a lot of confidence I can at least log on my assumptions um in order to use them further down the 
[42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2522) pathway into the assumptions and the traceability so you can back look back through all those links that you made and find the original Source um or you can find the 
[42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2535) insights that were directly used to cre to support something basically you can find all of the uh original sources or things immediately used for report for whatever uh Insight or takeaway that 
[42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2551) you've created drawbacks there are numerous drawbacks unfortunately this is the very beginning stages of me testing the system out but um it is doing basically 
[42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2565) all the things that I I really want or some of the most important things I want in a uh research management system a knowledge management system like this 
[42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2577) so I've just gone all in on it um for now we'll see if it breaks you know as it gets bigger that's one of the biggest uh issues so the system itself efficiency you know you 
[43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2595) could argue that it's inefficient to get real granular with all the logic steps like this but I think that um it's overall beneficial there's a net benefit to it 
[43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2607) because uh it allows you to come back at any time and know exactly where you uh derived some insight some takeaway from um pages are linked via front matter so we've already seen one issue with this 
[43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2623) you know by adding quotation marks into the file name you can break the link um so it it seems a bit brittle right now um but as long as that's the only way that I've found to break it so far so I 
[43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2638) just have to remember not to add quotation marks there there's also a risk of circular logic so as you might imagine as this thing continues to grow and grow and grow add more studies add 
[44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2649) more insights and lots of arrows going everywhere you may accidentally create a circle of uh logic and I would assume that doing this would give false positives in 
[44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2666) the uh original sources area you might have extra sources that aren't actually used uh to support whatever the Insight or the takeaway is that you're looking at I 
[44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2678) haven't done this yet but uh again as I imagine as this scales up uh that could become an issue risk of slowdown so the only times that I've seen major slow down with this 
[44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2692) again is if I've got just too many tabs open inside of obsidan Ian uh especially if they all use the metadata menu or Andor data view plugins so uh just be wary of 
[45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2706) that getting lost in the canvas again that's just something I'll have to see as the system grows um and yeah that's that's it so anyway hopefully that's helpful uh this 
[45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2721) is I'm Zach this is part of my Learning Journey and I thought that it would be helpful for some other people that log research and can draw conclusions from research and uh try to act on the 
[45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2733) available research out there so anyway hopefully that's helpful um if you liked it didn't like it let me know if you have ideas to upgrade it I love to hear them uh especially if you know your way 
[45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2_qc-vxCNY&t=2745) around metadata menus or data View and see other places for those to plug in that I haven't looked at yet so anyway that's it
