# Back to Coding
- I finally made real progress on [[Coding/The Odin Project (TOP)\|The Odin Project (TOP)]] project again this week after ~one month of very little work on it. That is embarrassing - I'm hoping that this blog will help keep me more focused by holding me accountable.
- Today I finished the [Intermediate HTML and CSS Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css) on the [Full Stack Javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) path. I deployed the final project on [GitHub pages](https://fliph19switch.github.io/admin-dashboard/) after working on it for several days. It took a lot longer than I thought it would. I ended up fighting a lot with [[SVG\|SVG]] files and the [[Coding/CSS/CSS Layouts/Grid\|Grid]] layout to get everything positioned correctly. I was determined to use [[Coding/CSS/CSS Layouts/Grid\|Grid]] as my only display type for the project, but I think that adding some [[Coding/CSS/CSS Layouts/Flexbox\|Flexbox]] into the mix could have helped a lot for certain parts. The project is currently fairly crude and unresponsive - I only did the basics as I'm ready to move on to the next course. I may return to the project in the future to polish it and make it responsive.
- I've been procrastinating a lot through the [Intermediate HTML and CSS Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css). One of the main reasons is the amount of friction I feel with [[Coding/CSS\|CSS]]. I just don't find CSS that interesting. I have a few projects in mind that I want to create, and when I think about working on those projects, I generally think about their mechanics and much less about their styling. Luckily, the [Javascript Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) is next and that will likely be much more engaging to me based on how much I enjoyed working with [[JavaScript\|JavaScript]] in the [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations). It could also help me with writing scripts in [[Research/Tags/Obsidian\|Obsidian]].
- I've used the [[Clockify\|Clockify]] [app](https://clockify.me/) since I started my coding journey last year. Here is a breakdown of how my the journey has gone so far:

# git commit -m
- [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxYC9-hBM_g) by [[Research/YouTube Channels/NetworkChuck\|NetworkChuck]] has inspired me to test out a local [[LLM\|LLM]]. If I understood it correctly, the video suggests that I could eventually set up an online chatbot that references my [[Research/Tags/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] notes for its responses. I think this is so cool - it aligns with how I want to blend my research background with my coding skills as I continue to develop them. I created a blank [[Public Whiteboards/Local LLM\|Local LLM]] whiteboard to add to whenever I have ideas on this.
- I added a whiteboard for my [[Public Whiteboards/Atomic Evidence\|Atomic Evidence]] setup - this is my personal system for cataloging and taking notes on various pieces of evidence. It's not up-to-date with all of the inner workings of my current system, so I will need to dedicate some time to it later.
## Coding Notes
- Minimum and maximum content sizes should be declared explicitly instead of relying on implicit values decided by the browser. The [[min()\|min()]] and [[max()\|max()]] functions are good to use for this. The [[minmax()\|minmax()]] function can also be used but only with [[Coding/CSS/CSS Layouts/Grid\|Grid]]. The [[clamp()\|clamp()]] function appears to allow even more control since holds minimum (generally static), maximum (generally static), and "ideal" (generally dynamic) sizes for content. [ref](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-advanced-grid-properties)
- Pairing [[minmax()\|minmax()]] with [[auto-fit\|auto-fit]] and [[auto-fill\|auto-fill]] helps with sizing content dynamically. I don't have a great grasp on how and when to use them though. [ref](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-advanced-grid-properties)
- The numbers used for [[grid-row\|grid-row]] and [[grid-column\|grid-column]] indicate the starting line and ending line for the implicit [[Coding/CSS/CSS Layouts/Grid\|Grid]] pattern. [ref](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-column)
