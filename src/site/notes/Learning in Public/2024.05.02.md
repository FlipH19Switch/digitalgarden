## Fasting
Today is day 4 of my 5-day fast. My hunger is more distracting today than previous days. I suspect that part of it is psychological since I am over halfway done - I am really looking forward to breaking my fast on Saturday morning and am planning out what I will eat.
## Regenerative Medicine
I began adding information to pages for stem-cell clinics (e.g. [[Research/Medical Facilities/Regenexx Cayman\|Regenexx Cayman]]). The pages have information structured based on the ideas I mapped out in the [[Public Whiteboards/Regenerative Medicine.excalidraw\|Regenerative Medicine.excalidraw]] whiteboard. My goal is to fill in all of the gaps for each of the pages, though some of the information may be difficult to find.

It's worth noting that I previously had treatments at the [[Research/Medical Facilities/Centeno-Schultz Clinic\|Centeno-Schultz Clinic]], which is the primary location for several doctors that work at Regenexx Cayman. And after investigating clinics to various degrees over the past ~year I have already decided on [[Research/Medical Facilities/Regenexx Cayman\|Regenexx Cayman]]. So I am biased towards the Regenexx Cayman clinic.
