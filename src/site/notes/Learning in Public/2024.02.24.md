# git commit -m
- I can now create timestamp-sectioned transcripts from YouTube videos inside of [[Research/Tags/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] using the [YTranscript plugin](https://github.com/lstrzepek/obsidian-yt-transcript/issues/38). This can help reduce the friction with extracting quotes from YouTube videos and build more confidence in their accuracy. It can also save time when first watching a video.
- I learned how to call a [[dataviewjs\|dataviewjs]] script inside of an Obsidian page with the help of the [Obsidian forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/trouble-calling-a-customjs-script/77369). This should help with leveraging [[dataviewjs\|dataviewjs]] scripts across different pages in Obsidian. I had tried the [CustomJS](https://github.com/saml-dev/obsidian-custom-js) plugin to do this before but was not successful.
- I added tags to all the entries in several of my Obsidian research databases. This should help with sorting through all of the database entries when mapping out the evidence and insights behind each of my [[Research Highlights\|Research Highlights]]. I used a separate database to hold pages as tags so that the same set of "tags" can be used across several databases. This is one shortcoming of the [[Notion\|Notion]]-like databases you can create in Obsidian by using the [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) and [DB Folder](https://github.com/RafaelGB/obsidian-db-folder) plugins together - I have not found an easy, automated way to ensure that the same set of tags are available in tag columns in multiple databases. Notion databases had a similar issue the last time I used them.
- I began testing an updated version of my workflow for creating [[Research Highlights\|Research Highlights]]. The workflow currently consists of stringing together insights I've derived from different evidence sources. The Notion-like databases I'm using to store and connect all of the pieces don't offer great visibility, so I'm testing the [Excalidraw](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) plugin in Obsidian to map everything out during the process. This will likely add time to the workflow but may reduce some of the friction with doing the work.
