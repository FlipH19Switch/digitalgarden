# git commit -m
## General
- I'm moving things around on the site to make it easier to navigate. The focus right now is on making it easier to find research content and updates.
- I'm using the [[Research/Tags/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] [Update frontmatter modified date](https://github.com/alangrainger/obsidian-frontmatter-modified-date) plugin to add reliable created and modified dates to my notes. It stores dates in the frontmatter and the dates are not corrupted when syncing via the Obsidian [Git](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git) plugin. These modified dates are published to the tops of some notes on the site.
## Research
- Big research push lately on various [[Public Research Overview/Research Topics\|Research Topics]] in an attempt to tackle my backlog and refine my workflow. I'm making updates to [[Public Whiteboards/Atomic Evidence.excalidraw\|Atomic Evidence.excalidraw]] as I continue to test ideas. I'll record a new walkthrough video when the workflow is more solid.
- I've added [[Public Research Overview/Quick Notes\|Quick Notes]] to help get ideas down. These are notes that I can make quickly without putting in as much effort as I do with [[Public Research Overview/Insights\|Insights]].
- I've added the [QuickAdd](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) plugin to help streamline the process for creating notes and adding them to a canvas.
