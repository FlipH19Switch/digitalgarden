# Clinic Assessment
## Personal Criticisms
### Claims
- Scientific references are often made available but are rarely tied directly to claims. For example, [the main science page](https://www.bioxcellerator.com/science) makes many claims about stem cells and their regenerative potential, but there is not a single inline citation for any of the claims. There is a section of references at the bottom of the page, but this is more of a reference repo for various conditions than it is a specific collection for the claims on the page.
### Testimonials
- Videos do not include information about whether patients were compensated in some way for their testimonials (e.g. [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiFD9bFb2uA&t=52s)).
### Blog
- Studies are not always cited properly when they are referenced. For example, [this page](https://www.bioxcellerator.com/blog/can-acl-tear-heal-on-its-own) refers to at least two studies but does not include any information to help the reader find the studies.
- It is not clear who writes their blog articles. For example, all nine of the blog articles I found on [page 1 of their blog](https://www.bioxcellerator.com/blog) listed "BioXcellerator" as the author ([link](https://www.bioxcellerator.com/blog/better-nutrition-through-this-diet-can-help-patients-with-ms-and-autoimmune-diseases), [link](https://www.bioxcellerator.com/blog/unlock-your-ultimate-potential-how-tony-robbins-life-force-can-transform-your-life-overnight), [link](https://www.bioxcellerator.com/blog/comparative-effectiveness-of-various-mesenchymal-stem-cell-sources-in-managing-knee-osteoarthritis), [link](https://www.bioxcellerator.com/blog/mesenchymal-stem-cell-therapy-for-knee-osteoarthritis-preliminary-report-of-four-patients), [link](https://www.bioxcellerator.com/blog/testing-the-safety-of-stem-cells-from-bone-marrow-in-treating-erectile-dysfunction-an-initial-study), [link](https://www.bioxcellerator.com/blog/microplastics-invisible-threats-visible-impacts-on-health), [link](https://www.bioxcellerator.com/blog/treatment-of-knee-osteoarthritis-with-mesenchymal-stem-cells-a-pilot-study), [link](https://www.bioxcellerator.com/blog/mesenchymal-stem-cells-and-induced-pluripotent-stem-cells-as-therapies-for-multiple-sclerosis), [link](https://www.bioxcellerator.com/blog/groundbreaking-hope-human-trial-offers-new-hope-for-chronic-spinal-cord-injuries)). Clicking on the author took me back to their homepage.
