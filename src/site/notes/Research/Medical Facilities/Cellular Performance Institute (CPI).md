I went to CPI last Aug I was having back issues had upper, mid, lower back all injected. I have multiple bulged disc. They only inject 3 at a time. They did inject multiple facets. I went to a hospital in the states because of back pain, numbness from my lower sternum to my knees and a very poor gate. If I closed my eyes in the shower I would almost fall over. After the MRI the dr told me I had a bulging disc T1-T2 with a severe spinal cord compression that needed emergency surgery. The Dr couldn’t say if T1-T2 was the cause of my symptoms. It wasn’t post surgery all my symptoms were still there. Numbness, pain, poor gate. That’s when I decided to try Stem cells. Cpi was the closest to my house that did back injections. The day after the injections the numbness was gone. It does still come back sometimes after being on my feet for hours, right by my belly button but goes away after some heat pad and stretches. My gate was a lot better after injections and is 95 percent normal. The 5 percent non normal is a result of my back surgery. I still have pain and tightness that has gotten better with active pt. I’m going to wait the full year till I decide if I need more injections. So yes stem cells are worth the money. And I am willing to spend it again. Also treated was my left knee and it feels 100 percent. Do your research before you decide where to go but choose stem cells over surgery IMO.
