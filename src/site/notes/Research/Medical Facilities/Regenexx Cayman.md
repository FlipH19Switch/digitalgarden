### Treatment summary
C3-4 and C4-5 received 5 million MSCs each, and each posterior cervical facet received about .67M cells.

T4-5, T5-6, T6-7, and T10-11 received 6M cells each, and each thoracic facet and rib facet received about 125,000 cells.

L5-S1 received 10M, and each lumbar facet received 1M MSCs.

An additional 6M cells were distributed in the ankles, feet, and hands bilaterally.

At 6 months there are no discernible improvements in any of the disc symptoms, and no discernible changes in disc morphology at any level on the amateur MRI reading.

There are some moderate improvements in the facets and the other synovial joints in the hands and feet. My amateur MRI skills aren’t good enough to compare these before and after.

A more detailed report will follow, and it will be on TV in August.

I suspect, but can’t prove, the main cause of the treatment failure was doing too much, too soon after the procedure.
### Results summary
No changes is disc height, hydration, bulge size, or annular tearing 6 months after intradiscal injection of autologous hypoxic cultured mesenchymal stem cells

## Initial post
### Documentary experience and post-treatment summary
Filmed in English, translated to German, and back to English subtitles. These people contacted me on here a year and a half ago and I agreed to let them followed me through my treatment in the Cayman Islands. All I will say is it’s extremely edited. I was a dud on camera, being on TV isn’t my thing I guess. I gave them what I gave them. Part of it was I was extremely unsure I should go forward with it, but was determined to press forward with it anyway, but I didn’t want to admit that. I spent a hell of a lot of time geeking out about stem cells and medical stuff, but didn’t do nearly as well talking about myself or my story, which I’m guarded about. The follow up was it six weeks and we left it open ended, but I was honest about how I was feeling at the time (negative). A year out, the result is that 80% of the areas treated got 50% better, but there are so many untreated areas (due to my poor bone marrow stem cell yield) that it hasn’t made much of an overall difference in my life. My T-spine, ankles, subtalar joints, and thumbs feel a hell of a lot better.

### Post-treatment approach to exercise (highDrugPrices4u)
It was a peculiar pattern. I saw changes immediately, they went away as soon as I put more than a little bit of stress on the joints. I was very discouraged for a long time. I stopped resistance training for 9 months to let my joints recover. It wasn’t until around 10-12 months out, after I had re-introduced exercise and the pain didn’t return to previous levels , that I realized I was definitely doing a lot better than before the procedure.

### Current cost expectations for Regenexx Cayman (highDrugPrices4u)
$21,500 is the price for the first level of intradiscal treatment. This price includes associated structures at that level, such as facets and ligaments. If you treat additional levels as part of the same procedure, you pay $2000 per level.

You will likely have cells left over, and these will be kept in storage for a future procedures. If you return for subsequent procedures using cells in storage, the cost for the first level is roughly $10,000 less.

The cost of travel is not looped into the treatment cost. In addition to the treatment cost, you have to bear the full cost of two trips to the Cayman Islands (one to harvest your cells, and a second trip for reinfection).

It is expensive and there is no guarantee of success, that is just the way it is.

### Post-treatment experience (highDrugPrices4u)
It did take a long time to get better and the first six months were super frustrating. About 10 months after the procedure, I started working out again and the pain didn’t return to anywhere near the previous levels. My lumbar disc didn’t do as well as the thoracic and cervical discs though.
### Treatment and results summary (highDrugPrices4u)
I had four thoracic discs injected with 6M MSCs and all the vertebral facets and rib facets injected with about 125,000 MSCs each in October 2022. I definitely got major improvement. I have a lot of discs affected in the thoracic area, and we only treated four of the worst ones, so I still have significant symptoms, but the overall situation in my thoracic spine seems vastly improved.

These were autologous, bone marrow derived stem cells. Not umbilical cells.
